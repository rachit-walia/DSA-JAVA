A stream is sequencof data. In java a stream is composed of bytes.
In java 3 stream are created for us automatically:
1. System.out ;- standard output stream
2. System.in : standard input stream
3. system.err : standard error stream

types of stream
1. Byte stream: 
    i. Input stream
    ii. Output stream
2. character stream
    i.Reader
    ii. Writer


byte stream: java byte stream are used to perform input and output of 8 bits/ 1byte at a time from binary file

InputStream and OutputStream class are most commonly used classes of byte stream

Byte input stream:
1. fileinput stream
2. Sequence input stream
3. piped input stream
4. object input stream
5. Byte array input stream
6. StringBuffer input stream
7. FilterinputStream--BufferinputStream, DataInputStream,PushBackInputStream

1. FileInputStream: input stream that read from a file
2. SequenceInputStream: input stream that is used to combine 2 or more input stream.
3. PipedInputStream: Input stream used to read from a pipe
4. ObjectInputStream: used to read an object from inout stream
5. ByteInputStream: used to read a byte array from input stream
6. StringBufferinputStream: used to read from a stringBuffer object.
7. FilterInoutStream: an instance of this class contains some other input stream as a basic source of data for further manipulation.
            There are 3 types of FilterinputStream

i.BufferinputStream: provide buffer facility to the input stream.
ii.DataInputStream: Use to read primitive data type from input stream
iii.PushBackInputStream: provides unreading facilityto input stream.

ways of using FileInputStream

1. FileInputStream=new FileInputStream("c:/java/hello.txt");
here directly path is specified while creating the FilterInoutStream

2.File f=new file("c:/java/hello.txt");
FileInputStream fin;
fin=new FileInputStream(f);



        // Output stream 
the output stream will only create a file if doesnt already exisr, before opening it for output.


OutputStream :
1.FileoutputStream
2.FilterOutputStream-- BufferedOutputStream, DataOutputStream, PrintStream
3. ByteOutputStream
4. StringBufferOutputStream
5.PipedOutputStream


FileoutputStream: used to write data into a file
PipedOutputStream: used to write data to a pipe
ObjectOutputStream: used to write object to a output stream
ByteArrayOutputStream: used to write data to a byte array.
FilterOutputStream: i. BufferedOutputStream- provide buffer facility to output stream.
                    ii. bufferOutputStream: used to write primitive data to output stream
                    iii. Printstream: used to print any data on output stream

FileoutputStream is used to create file and write data into it.

Ways to using file with FileOutputStream:
1. FileoutputStream fout=new fileoutputstream("c:/java/hello.txt");
2. File f = new File("c:/java/hello.txt");
FileoutputStream fout;
fout=new fileoutputstream(f);
