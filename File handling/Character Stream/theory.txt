Character stream

Introduction: a stream is a sequence of data. In java a stream is composed of bytes

character stream are used to perform input and output of 16 bits/ 2bytes at a time from character file.

Reader and writer are most common classes of character stream

charcter stream reader class

Reader: InputStreamReader--> filereader
        BufferedReader   --> LineNumberReader
        FilterReader     --> pushBackReader
        StringReader
        PipedReader

reader class: with the character based streams we can read pf text. A line of text . A line of carrier return and linefeed

i.FileReader: used to read from files. it extends InputStreamReader class that translate byte to character
ii. BufferReader: provides buffer facility to the reader class
iii. lineNumberReader: this class extends bufferReader and also keeps record of line number of these buffered streams
iv. StringReader: used to read from a string.
v. pushBackReader: provides unreading facility to reader class
vi PipedReader: used to read from the pipe



writer class: abstract class that define character stream output. if you need to change these values , you can use the output/streamWriter

types of writer class:

i.Filewriter: used to write from files. it extends outputStreamReader class that translate byte to character

ii. Buffewriterr: provides buffer facility to the writer class

iii:piper writer: used tp write data to a pipe

iv PrintWriter: used to print any writer data to a pipe

v.filterWriterclass: it is an abstract class which is used to write filtered charcater streams.


Creating FileReader and Filewriter

FileReader:

FileReader fr=new fileReader("c:/java/hello.txt");
// file path is specifies in arguments

File f=new File("c://java/hello.txt");
fileReader fr=new filereader(f);

FileWriter:

java FileWriter class is used to write charcater data to the file
there are two ways to create fileWriter object:
FileWriter fw=new FileWriter("c:/java/hello.txt");

File f=new File("c://java/hello.txt");
FileWriter fw fr=new FileWriter(f);
